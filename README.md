# 8BitBounce

## Overview

Welcome to the **8BitBounce** project! This unique physics engine integrates directly with your Windows desktop, turning your desktop windows into interactive physics objects. Whether you're a developer looking for an innovative project or simply a physics enthusiast, this engine offers a fun and educational way to explore physics simulations right on your desktop.

## Features

- **Interactive Controls**: Right-click on any physics object to bring up a dropdown menu with various options to control its properties.
- **Desktop Collision Detection**: Physics objects will collide with other non-maximized or popup desktop windows, creating a dynamic and interactive environment.
- **Gravity Calculations**: Includes realistic gravity effects, where objects with significant mass can exert a gravitational pull on others. Typically negligible until the mass reaches extreme values (e.g., 1 Quintillion mass).
- **Multi-threading**: Efficient performance through multi-threading, ensuring smooth and responsive simulations.
- **Seamless Desktop Integration**: Runs directly on top of your Windows desktop, allowing you to interact with your existing windows as part of the simulation.

## Installation

3. **Run the executable**:
   You can run the executable from the release to start the physics engine on your desktop.

## Usage

1. **Start the engine**: Run the executable. You will see your the physics objects fall into your desktop with an exit button on the top left of your screen.

2. **Interact with objects**: Right-click on any physics object to access the dropdown menu. Here, you can adjust various properties such as mass, restitution, and world gravity.

3. **Observe collisions**: Watch as physics objects collide with each other and with other desktop windows that are not maximized or popups.

4. **Experiment with gravity**: Add objects with extreme mass values to observe gravitational effects on other objects.
